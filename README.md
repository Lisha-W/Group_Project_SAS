Preface - Bank Customer Churn SAS Group Project

This group project illustrates a predictive analytics solution for a bankâ€™s customer churn. Using SAS miner, we analyzed customer demographics and behaviour. We preprocessed the data to build models, including decision trees, regressions, and neural networks. The multiple models were used to determine accuracy as well as which customer features would indicate a high risk of churning.  In addition, our team used these models to provide actionable insights for the bank to reduce customer churn. 
In this project, my role was to engage in data preprocessing and modeling. This involves data cleaning, transformation, and validation. In addition, I also built the predictive models for analysis of customer churn.
